**Purpose**
The purpose of this application is to help users expedite the burdensome task of finding the perfect entertainment media to enjoy. It does this by offering a user-friendly platform that aggregates streaming availability, ratings, and recommendations in one place. As well, you are probably subscribed to numerous streaming services such as Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, etc. You don’t know if a show is always on one of these streaming platforms, so you do the tiresome task of going to each streaming service, searching for the movie, until you realize it is not on any of these streaming platforms, which wastes about 10 minutes of your time.
