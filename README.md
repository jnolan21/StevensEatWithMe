**Introduction**
Deciding where to eat on campus can be challenging and overwhelming, especially with so many dining locations and ever-changing menus. Our platform makes it easy for Stevens Institute of Technology students to share real-time reviews, ratings, and updates about campus dining locations. Whether you’re looking for the best meal at Pierce Dining Hall, the shortest wait time at the Gateway Cafe, or simply want to see what’s available to eat before heading out, our application provides the information you need. Additionally, our platform fosters community by allowing students to coordinate meal-time meetups, so no student has to eat alone. With all these features in one place, EatWithMe will revolutionize the dining experience at Stevens.

**Purpose**
The purpose of this application is to create a central hub for Stevens students to share dining experiences, making it easier to decide where, when, and what to eat. Users can rate individual food items, review restaurants, and provide real-time updates on wait times and availability at all campus dining locations. For those looking to dine at Pierce Dining Hall, students can post what food is currently available that day and attach images so others know what to expect. Beyond reviews and updates, the application encourages social dining and community by allowing students to set up and RSVP for group meals. Whether you’re a freshman looking to meet new people or you just don’t want to eat alone, our platform helps bring Stevens students together over shared meals.
